            <h2>About Dharamshala Stadium</h2>
            <p>Earlier, plans were made by the BCCI and the state government to construct an international stadium in Shimla, with the proposed location being Annadale. However, the Army rejected the proposal, citing the strategic importance of Annadale as a cantonment area. Consequently, the plan was shifted to Dharamshala, where the HPCA Stadium was finally built.</p>
            <p>The stadium serves as the home ground for the Himachal Pradesh cricket team for Ranji Trophy and other domestic matches. It also hosted IPL matches as a home stadium for Punjab Kings, offering breathtaking views of the surrounding Himalayan ranges.</p>
